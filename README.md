# Welcome to the CUDA-QX repository

This repository contains a set of libraries that build on 
NVIDIA CUDA-Q. These libraries enable the rapid development of hybrid quantum-classical 
application code leveraging state-of-the-art CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. 

## Getting Started
To learn more about how to work with the CUDA-QX libraries, please take a look at the 
[CUDA-QX Documentation][cudaqx_docs]. The page contains detailed 
[installation instructions][official_install] for officially released packages.
